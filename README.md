## Description of Project

<!--- Add the description of your project in this section -->

#### My project contains curated resources for the developer who wants to learn about Appwrite. This is really a good place for beginners. Because in this project we have two sections means, we have divided the content of blogs into two sections in which the first one is for those who know any backend framework and the second one is for those who don't know about any of the backend frameworks.

Anyone interested in contributing to our blogs can contribute simply by some clicks this makes the project more powerful because the blogs are maintained by the open-source community.

## How Appwrite helped you build this project?

- Appwrite Databases - Appwrite databases are simple, secure, and scalable. And it is very easy to use in our web application. I used the databases to store the content of the blog and fetch it as the user goes to the webpage.

- Appwrite Authentication - Leveraging Appwrite's authentication capabilities, various OAuth integrations were implemented in the web application, enhancing the user experience.

## Challenges We Faced

<!--- Mentions what challenges you faced in the development process and how you overcame those -->

One of the most challenging tasks during the development process was working on the CSS part of the code. This task often required a significant amount of time to fix bugs and ensure the desired styling. To overcome this challenge, various strategies were employed. Watching YouTube tutorials and researching solutions on the internet proved to be valuable resources in finding solutions to CSS bugs and improving the overall styling of the project.
